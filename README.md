# Video Game Sales - Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis and data cleaning techniques using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It is designed for beginners who want to practice and enhance their skills in data manipulation, exploration, and visualization. The dataset used contains information on video game sales, providing a practical scenario to apply key data analysis concepts.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project includes a list of video games and related sales data. This data offers insights into global and regional sales figures, as well as other game-specific information like genre, publisher, and release year.

## Python Libraries Used:
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations and handling of multidimensional arrays.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating basic plots and visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced and aesthetically pleasing statistical plots.

## Features Covered:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, fixing data types, and managing outliers.
3. **Data Visualization**: Plotting various graphs to visualize relationships in the data.
   
## Conclusion:
By the end of this project, you'll have hands-on experience with key data analysis and visualization techniques that are essential for data analysts. The analysis of the video game sales dataset provides a practical context for learning how to work with real-world data.
